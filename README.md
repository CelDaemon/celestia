### A very basic RPG game engine / library for java.

Uses the latest java standards, like string interpolation, fast native access using project panama, module based dependencies, and cross-platform support using GLFW.

Because preview features are being used, it is required to enable them using a vm flag when using this library.
Instead of being run as a jar directly, this library should be added as a dependency using gradle/maven and `module-info.java` file.
